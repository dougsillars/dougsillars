### Hi! Im Doug.

There's a lot of disparate content in this repository, but in many ways it is an assortment of projects (completed, uncompleted and some never started) that have arisen in my head.  Many were for previous jobs...Sone were for myself.  And there's also my father-in-law's book.

I am a Developer Relations Lead.  What is developer relations?


# Speaking

* Developer Advocates often speak at conferences.  Many think that's all we do (it is not!) I've done a [fair bit of publc speaking](https://speakofthedevrel.cloud/speaking) as a part of my career.

# Writing:

DevRels often do a lot of writing.  Blog posts, tutorials, documentation

## Blogs.  

I write a lot for the companies I work at.  You can also Check out my [personal blog](https://speakofthedevrel.cloud).

## Documentation

Here I am "working on the docss"
![A physical manifistation of working on the docs](https://github.com/dougsillars/dougsillars/assets/1514288/4e3c8d9c-71e9-4b4d-a8c1-eaeba14dd844)

Documentation is a process that is never complete. New features are added.  Changes are made to existing products.  Pages are re-written for clarity.  Good documentation is a core attribute to an excellent product.

## Book
[High Performance Android Apps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9m5z_nQjKE2Vmp1WkwtQjlPVkU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-FTIvkdmwgF9IJgidyDCYlw)  I wrote this book!  Here's the repo of [sample apps](https://github.com/dougsillars/HighPerformanceAndroidApps).


## Tutorials

Many docs also come with tutorials. "how do I do X with Y?"  Here - let's walk through the steps.  There are a bunch of tutorials mixed into my repositories here.  Many of my tutorials/sample apps arise from questions from users or customers who are struggling with a feature. We'll create a solution for them, but then share the solution so *everyone* can benefit from it.

# Developer[0]:  
Often your DevRel team is the first developer outside of the devteam to try out a product.  As a primary and regular user of the tool, I often have feedback on improvements.  I also often find bugs, create issues and even fix them :D.  

# Support: 
While many think of developer relations as 'top of funnel' (meaning attracting people to the technology or tool), I spend a lot of time supporting questios from existing customers.  Fielding these questions with empathy and understanding is improtant - generally the developer has tried a way around the issue already.  Work with them, fix the issue - and then create bugs, update the docs, create a new tutorial. (As you can see, many of these processes are circular.)

# Community:

A community is more than "we've got a Slack (discord/forum/etc.)."  The people in your Slack are important, and shouldn't be ignored!  But it is important to not put up a fence and call it community.

A community is all of your users, but also everyone else in your field who is searching for a solution. By talking with different organizations, other Slack channels, you can raise awareness of your community and how it works - and the Venn diagram two groups will begin to have a larger intersection.
