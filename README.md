### Hi! Im Doug.

There's a lot of disparate content in this repository, but in many ways it is an assortment of projects (completed, uncompleted and some never started) that have arisen in my head.  Many were for previous jobs...Sone were for myself.  And there's also my father-in-law's book.

I am a Developer Relations Lead.  What is developer relations?

* Speaking:  Developer Advocates often speak at conferences.  Many think that's all we do (it is not!) I've done a [fair bit of publc speaking](https://speakofthedevrel.cloud/speaking) as a part of my career.

Lets start with Books:

[Bo Diddley](https://dougsillars.github.io/BoDiddley/) My FIL Denis Lane wrote this book. Due to contractual stuff, it was never published. Cleaning my MIL's house, I found it on a floppy, so I bought a USB floppy reader. Converted the text to markdown, and open sourced it for them.

[High Performance Android Apps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9m5z_nQjKE2Vmp1WkwtQjlPVkU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-FTIvkdmwgF9IJgidyDCYlw)  I wrote this book!  Here's the repo of [sample apps](https://github.com/dougsillars/HighPerformanceAndroidApps).
